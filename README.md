## Hey there! 👋

I’m [**Vishwa**](https://www.vishwaelankumaran.com), a Data Scientist specialized in turning data into reliable, high-performance machine learning solutions.

I work on data pipelines, modeling, and production-grade ML systems with a strong focus on accuracy, speed, and scalability. I care as much about clean data and solid evaluation as I do about deployment.

If a model is slow, unstable, or poorly validated — I’ll optimize it.

Main stack:  
Python, Pandas/Polars, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, SQL, FastAPI, Docker, AWS, GCP and more ...

Most of my repositories focus on machine learning, data analysis, automation, and model deployment.  
My pinned projects highlight real-world ML use cases and production-ready pipelines.

Always learning. Always optimizing.

### Fun Facts:
- I train consistently at the gym
- I enjoy building ML tools more than dashboards  
- I care more about performance than flashy visuals  
- **Hobbies**: data science, fitness, building things, watching anime
