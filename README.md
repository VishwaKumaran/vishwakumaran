## Hey there! 👋

I’m [**Vishwa**](https://www.vishwaelankumaran.com), a Data Scientist who loves turning complex problems into automated, scalable, and production-ready systems.

I specialize in data pipelines, machine learning models, and end-to-end automation, with a strong focus on performance, reliability, and clean engineering. If a process can be automated, I’ll automate it.

I also work with cloud infrastructure to deploy and monitor real-world ML systems.

Main stack:  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, SQL, FastAPI, Docker, AWS, GCP, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and more ...

Most of my repositories focus on machine learning, data automation, cloud-ready backends, and model deployment.  
My pinned projects highlight real-world ML systems built for scale.

Always building. Always automating. Always optimizing.

### Fun Facts:
- I train consistently at the gym  
- I enjoy automating boring tasks  
- I care more about system efficiency than dashboards  
- **Hobbies**: data science, automation, fitness
